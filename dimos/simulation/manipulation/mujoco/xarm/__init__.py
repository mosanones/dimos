"""xArm simulation driver and blueprints.

This module provides xArm-specific simulation implementations that mirror
the hardware xArm driver interface.

Usage:
    # Direct instantiation
    from dimos.simulation.manipulation.mujoco.xarm import XArmSimDriver
    driver = XArmSimDriver(dof=7)
    driver.start()

    # Via blueprints
    from dimos.simulation.manipulation.mujoco.xarm import xarm7_sim_servo
    coordinator = xarm7_sim_servo.build()
    coordinator.loop()
"""
