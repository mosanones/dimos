"""Standard TF frame IDs for the SmartNav navigation stack.

Follows the ROS REP-105 frame convention:

    map → odom → body

- **map**: Global, loop-closure-corrected frame (published by PGO).
- **odom**: Continuous, locally smooth frame with no jumps (published by FastLio2).
- **body**: Robot body / IMU frame.
